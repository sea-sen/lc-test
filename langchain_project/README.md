# Basic Langchain Project

This is a simple Python project demonstrating a basic Langchain application.
It uses an OpenAI LLM to generate jokes based on a user-provided topic.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the files as listed).**

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `langchain_project` directory and install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your OpenAI API Key:**
    This project requires an OpenAI API key to function.
    -   You can get an API key from [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
    -   Set your API key as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
        -   On Linux/macOS:
            ```bash
            export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
            ```
        -   On Windows (Command Prompt):
            ```bash
            set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
            ```
        -   On Windows (PowerShell):
            ```bash
            $env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
            ```
    Replace `'your_api_key_here'` with your actual API key. You might want to add this line to your shell's startup file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) to make it permanent.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have completed the setup steps above (dependencies installed and API key set).
2.  Navigate to the `langchain_project` directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4.  The script will prompt you to enter a topic for a joke. Type a topic and press Enter.
5.  The application will then display a joke generated by the OpenAI LLM.
